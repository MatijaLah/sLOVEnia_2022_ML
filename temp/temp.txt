### description

In the past years we’ve noticed an upward trend in the number of data-related User Groups and conferences sprouting up in Europe and all over the world. The data community is a great community and there are a lot of talented international speakers ready to share their knowledge.<br><br>Recognition is key and there are not many opportunities for local talent to grow their acknowledgement as a lot of international speakers fill in speaker slots quickly. This doesn’t leave much room for the rising stars. With dataMinds Saturday 2024 we want to shift the focus and pass the mic along to local talent, granting them their place in the spotlight and offering them the opportunity to add more speaking experience to their portfolio.<br><br>dataMinds is therefore organising another edition of dataMinds Saturday on April 27th 2024 with a focus on Microsoft Data & AI Platform enthusiasts residing in Belgium ready to deliver great content.
